                <h3>
                    Highschool
                </h3>
                Hello, I come from Besançon, a small town in Franche-Comté in the east of France. I spent my high school years in a binational section, specifically Franco-German. After these three years in this section I got my ABITUR with a total of 2.8 points out of 4. My specialties in high school were SVT, English and Mathematics, unfortunately it will be in terminal that I will regret not having chosen the computer science specialty.

                    Interest
                </h2>
                I developed my interest in computer science at the beginning of the final year. Indeed, this environment was totally unknown to me. In order to inform myself I started reading books such as: (X) HTML / Javascript for dummies. As my passion for computer science grew what led me to join the GOAL network and telecommunication.
